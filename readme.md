TAfT - Temporal Analysis of fMRI data Toolbox
---------------------------------------------

This is an early stage, alpha version of a toolbox that should allow analysing fMRI-informed EEG as described in Hauser, Hunt et al (J Neurosci, 2015).
A further description about the procedure and embedding can be found in the file 2015_06_25_flowchart.pptx

Installation
------------
This repository should be transferred into the Toolbox folder of SPM (SPM/toolbox/TAFT/). It can then be launched using the SPM batch GUI, where all the steps can be specified.


Warning
-------
This is an untested version of the toolbox. If you spot bug, please report to Tobias. Unfortunately, we cannot provide full support, but we will try to help as much as we can.
